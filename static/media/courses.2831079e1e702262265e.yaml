- title: User eXperience
  instructor: Joongseek Lee
  department: Intelligence and Information
  term: Spring
  description: User experience is the process of improving user satisfaction while using information systems and services. The concept emerged in the 90s with the development of the service industry and the web, and became even more important with the ubiquity of smartphones in the 2000s. However, the emergence of transcendent technologies such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, robotics, and VR in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution has created a need for a new understanding of user experience. In this context, this class covers traditional methods of experience analysis and design, and examines their limitations and shortcomings. It critiques the limited view of experience as merely instrumental or compositional, and attempts to distinguish and understand different experience modalities. The class will cover traditional methods of designing experiences and ICT-based information experiences, and will go through the process of experiencing, recording, and organizing experiences. The class will then discuss the speculative ontology needed to analyze and understand the new experiences brought about by transcendent technologies, and how they can be captured and organized.

- title: Human Computer Interaction
  instructor: Joongseek Lee
  department: Intelligence and Information
  term: Fall
  description: Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a multidisciplinary field of study focusing on the design of computer technology and, in particular, the interaction between humans (the users) and computers. While initially concerned with computers, HCI has since expanded to cover almost all forms of information technology design. Information systems, including computers, have now become indispensable systems for everyday life and work. However, integrating these systems with human processes can present complex problems, primarily due to their abstract and symbolic nature, along with the issue of surrogate operation. The field of HCI seeks to solve these problems. HCI is a mediation discipline that focuses on the mediation between humans and technology, aiming to create better tools. Through this mediation process, HCI's goal is to develop interfaces that are intuitive, easy to learn, error-free, and provide high satisfaction for the users. The discipline of HCI requires multidisciplinary knowledge, including ergonomics, cognitive science, and it is currently undergoing a transition towards phenomenology. In this introductory course on HCI, students will accumulate knowledge in the domain of HCI while learning about its history and various research methodologies. We will explore the fundamental challenges of human-computer interaction, the diverse theoretical perspectives that underpin the field, and the methods used in HCI research.


- title : Data Analysis and Visualization
  instructor: Hyunwoo Park
  department: Data Science
  term : Fall
  description : Businesses and organizations today collect and store unprecedented quantities of data. In order to make informed decisions with such a massive amount of the accumulated data, organizations seek to adopt and utilize data mining and machine learning techniques. Applying advanced techniques must be preceded by a careful examination of the raw data. This step becomes increasingly important and also easily overlooked as the amount of data increases because human examination is prone to fail without adequate tools to describe a large dataset. Another growing challenge is to communicate a large dataset and complicated models with human decision makers. Exploratory data analysis, and visualizations in particular, helps find patterns in the data and communicate the insights in an effective manner. This course aims to equip students with methods and techniques to summarize and communicate the underlying patterns of different types of data. In addition to creating high-quality static visualizations, this course teaches students how to build an interactive visual analysis system
